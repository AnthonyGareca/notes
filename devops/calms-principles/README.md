# DevOps Principles: The CALMS Framework

[back](../README.md)

John Willis and Damon Edwards coined the acronym CAMS in 2010 which was later expanded to CALMS by Jez Humble.

CALMS stands for: Culture, Automation, Lean, Measurement, Sharing.

## Culture

* Companies that adopt DevOps must be able to cultivate a culture of collaboration.
* Engineers and IT operations professionals work in tandem, instead of competing against one another to reach certain metrics or achieve certain goals.
* Each group's goals are better aligned and both teams work side-by-side in quality assurance testing.
* Working together allows the teams to quickly identify bugs, focus on solutions and implements quick fixes, all in the span of a few days.
* DevOps culture is one that embraces change, is constantly seeking feedback in order to improve, and seeks to take accountability and responsibility, not shirk it or pass it onto other people.
* A DepObs culture seeks to push decision making responsibility as close to the edge (autonomy) as opposed to centralising all decision making (Command&Control).

## Automation

* Putting repetitive and repeatable process in place helps to speed up work and create reliable systems.
* Continuous Delivery essentially means that engineering and operations teams are continuously testing code and deploying on a faster basis.
* This reduces the risks involved and allows for development team to stay on top of any fixed that need attention.
* Team members seek out ways to automate as many tasks as possible and are comfortable with the idea of continuous delivery.


## Lean

* In term of DebOps, "lean" means trimming the auxiliary parts of software development away, so only the absolutely necessary processes remain.
* A DevOps mindset involves constantly tinkering with processes to make them as efficient as possible.
* Teams must have an agile-first mentality when crafting a product, meaning that they put out a simple product first and make continuous improvements to it in order to craft a perfect product a few months or years down the road.
* Lean seeks to achieve Flow, the smooth transition of work from one "work centre" to the next, in the minimum time. Ideally with as few queues/buffers as possible.

## Measurement

* DevOps employs a slew tools and technologies that help measure performance and map out realistic KPIs(Key Performance Indicator).
* Common measurements taken in  a DevOps environment are:
  * How many tickets were being pushed per release?
  * How many bugs did we find (and how long did it take to fix them)?
  * How many total user were affected by bugs?
  * What is our application's response time?
  * How long does it take from Code Commit to Production Deployment? (Lead time)
  * How frequently are you deploying to production? Multiple times per day? Per week? Per month? Per year? (Change frequency)
  * How often does a change introduces a bug into production? (Change failure rate)
  * How long does it take you to restore service in the case of an incident? (Mean Time to Repair MTTR)

## Sharing

* Instead of having totally separate jobs, engineers and operations now share responsibilities.
* This sense of sharing a goal (and the challenges that come with achieving it) bridges divides between teams and promotes a culture of collaboration.
* The sharing aspect of DevOps believes that the same people who build the application should also be the same ones to ship it and maintain it.
* Sharing fills in the gaps of the development process, and it ensures that all teams take a hands-on approach from start to finish.
* There are user-friendly communication channels that encourage ongoing communication between development and operations.
* Sharing a focus on breaking down silos between departments and sharing knowledge and best practices.
