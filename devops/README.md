* Use **declarative** formats for setup automation.
* Have a **clean contract** with the operating system.
* Are suitable for **deployment on modern cloud platform**.
* **Minimize divergence** between development and production.
* Can **scale up** without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.
