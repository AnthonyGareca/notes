## [Access Modifier](./access-modifier/README.md)

All types and type members have an accessibility level. The accessibility level controls whether they can be used from other code in your assembly or other assemblies.

## [Keywords var and dynamic](./var-dynamic/README.md)

Variables declared with *var* are implicitly but statically typed. Variables declared with *dynamic* are dynamically typed. This means that *dynamic* declarations are resolved at runtime, *var* declarations are resolved at compile time.

## [Anonymous Types](./anonymous-types/README.md)

Anonymous Types provide a convenient way to encapsulate a set of read-only properties into a single object without having to explicitly define a type first.

## [Anonymous Functions](./anonymous-functions/README.md)

An anonymous function is an "inline" statement or expression that can be used wherever a delegate type is expected. You can use it to initialize a named delegate or pass it instead of a named delegate type as a method parameter.

## [Delegates](./delegates/README.md)

A delegate is a type that represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type.
