# Collections

[back](../README.md)

For many applications, you want to create and manage groups of related objects. There are two ways to group objects: by creating arrays of objects, and by creating collections of objects.

Arrays are most useful for creating and working with a fixed number of strongly typed objects.

Collections provide a more flexible way to work with groups of objects. A collection is a class, so you must declare an instance of the class before you can add elements to that class.

Many common collections are provided by .NET. Each type of collection is designed for a specific purpose:

* `System.Collections.Generic` classes
* `System.Collections.Concurrent` classes
* `System.Collections` classes

## [`System.Collections.Generic` classes](./collections-generic/README.md)
