## Test Types

Having automated tests is a great way to ensure that application code does what its authors intend it to do.

### Unit test

A *unit test* is a test that exercises individual software components or methods, also known as "unit of work". Unit test only test code within the developer's control. They  don not test infrastructure concerns. Infrastructure concerns include interacting with databases, file systems, and network resources.

### Integration test

In *integration test* differs from a unit test in that it exercises two or more software components' ability to function together, also know as their "integration". These tests operate on a broader spectrum of the system under test, whereas unit tests focus on individual components. Often, integration tests do include infrastructure concerns.

### Load test

A *load test* aims to determine whether or not a system can handle a specific load, for example, the number of concurrent users using an application and the app's ability to handle interactions responsively.
